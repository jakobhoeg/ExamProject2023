# Run backend and start frontend:

## Start backend
To run the backend on docker open the ExamProject folder in CMD and type:
docker-compose up -d

## Now start the frontend development server
- Open the "FrontendVite" folder in Visual Studio Code.
- Now open a terminal (CTRL + Ã†)
- Type "npm run dev" (If that doesn't work, you might have to install dependencies first, by typing "npm install").
- Go to http://localhost:5173

For now its just a simple login + register that calls the backend.
Also created the navigation bar.
